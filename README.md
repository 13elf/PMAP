# Description

Pmap is a tool that replicates nmap to find open ports of computers on a given network. It's similar to the connect scan of nmap since it connects to the target and interprets the result. But the difference lies in speed. There are cases where nmap is much faster that pmap (which is the case for most scans when there's no proxy in place)
